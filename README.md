# 📺 Media Manager Ultimate v1.9.7
**Automated TV Show Renaming for Plex, Jellyfin, and Emby**

Media Manager Ultimate is a Python-based GUI utility that organizes your media library by syncing your local files with **The Movie Database (TMDb)**. It ensures your shows are named perfectly so that media servers like Plex and Jellyfin can fetch metadata, posters, and episode summaries without errors.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Fuzzy Title Matching:** Automatically pairs messy filenames with official episode titles using string similarity scoring.
* **Sequential Numeric Matching:** Quickly renames files based on their directory order—perfect for new season rips.
* **TMDb Integration:** Pulls real-time data from the official TMDb API.
* **Dynamic Theme Engine:** Supports 9 visual styles (Slate, Emerald, Midnight, etc.) with a zero-glare dark mode.
* **Safety First:** Interactive "Preview" mode lets you see exactly what will happen before a single file is renamed.

## 🔑 TMDb API Integration

### 🛠️ Setup Instructions
1.  **Get a Key:** Sign up for a free account at [TheMovieDB.org](https://www.themoviedb.org/) and generate a **v3 API key** in your account settings.
2.  **Add to Program:**
    * Launch the application.
    * Navigate to **File > Settings**.
    * Paste your key into the **TMDb API Key** field.
    * Click **Save Settings**.
3.  **Security:** Your key is stored locally in an auto-generated `config.json` file. It is never shared, uploaded, or hardcoded into the source.

> **Note:** The "Search TMDb" and "Preview" features will return errors until a valid API key is saved in the Settings menu.
